# ESLint Configuration

## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule
The "semi" lint rule is important in a repository or in any project where there are multiple contributors because of javascript code can be vague in terms of how it will be interpreted if the use of semi-colons is not consistent. With the rule set to either always or never, the possibility for confusion will be reduced as if there is a bug, it is likely not related to javascripts interperation of where a semi-colon should be.
